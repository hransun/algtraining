Process vs Thread (frequently asked 8%)
- Processes are independent and contain their own state information. Threads run within a process and share the same state and memory space
- Processes have to communicate with each other using interprocess communication mechanisms. Threads communicate directly because they share the same variables.
- Context switching between threads is faster than between processes.
What is a mutex? Semaphore? Binary semaphore? (frequently asked 4%)
- mutex is a binary lock, same as binary semaphore. Generic semaphore allows access to more then one thread at time (depending on number of resources)
What is a small IO?What is a large IO? Numbers for seek times and scan rates?
- Small IO is where a single(or few) block random IO is done. Main cost is seek time (~10ms)
- Large IO is where large number of blocks are read sequentially. Seek time is amortized. Main cost is scan rate.
What is RAID?
- Redundant Array of Independent Disks (expanding the acronym is not important - candidate should intuitively know what RAID is)
- Two main ideas: mirroring and striping. Mirroring gives protection against drive failure and striping gives performance. This is the gist
What is a transaction?
Candidate does not necessarily need to define ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) but should intuitively know what it means to provide transactional semantics in a concurrent, multi-threaded environment. Should at least describe atomicity and isolation.
Stack vs Heap (frequently asked 5%)
Stack is for a thread/program to allocate local program variables. Heap is for dynamic allocation of memory.  Stack memory is allocated at compile time. Heap memory is allocated at runtime.

Difference between UDP and TCP? Follow-up: What layer is HTTP? Is HTTP TCP or UDP based? (frequently asked 5%)
- UDP and TCP are both transport layer. TCP is reliable and connection based. UDP is connectionless and unreliable.
- HTTP is application layer. It is normally TCP based since HTTP assumes a reliable transport.
What is virtual memory? How does it work? (frequently asked 5%)
- Creates a bigger memory address space than actual RAM. Working set kept is RAM and rest swapped to disk (swap space). Thrashing can occur if working set is larger than RAM.
What is a memory mapped file? (frequently asked 4%)
It is a segment of virtual memory that has a byte-for-byte correlation for some portion of a file.  Benefits: Increased IO performance (faster than direct reads and writes). Common uses - process loader in most operating systems.
What is write-through cache? What is write-back (copy-back) cache? Which is faster?
- Write-through cache:  Every write to cache is persisted to the actual source (e.g. disk) at time of write.
- Write-back cache: Writes are not immediately mirrored to the actual source. Cache tracks locations that are dirty and these are persisted upon eviction or lazily.
- Write-back is faster
What is paging? What is a page fault?
- Retrieval of data from secondary storage into main memory. Important part of virtual memory implementation.
- Page fault is when a program tries to access pages that are not currently not loaded into RAM
Several questions around Java garbage collection and memory leaks
- Can Java leak memory?
- How can it, since Java has an automatic garbage collector?
- What are some common ways that memory leaks are introduced?
- How would you recognize and fix a memory leak in one of your programs?
The goal is to see if they have ever thought about the underpinnings of the JVM\'s memory system, They assume that what you are testing for is just recall of Java garbage collection principles, not understanding or explaining what actually goes into writing a collector.
Scoring:
- A great candidate will  
- Know that Java can leak memory, and explain how inappropriately held references can cause it
- Can describe how to recognize and debug a memory leak, as well as be able to reference some of the available tools.
- Take no more than 5 minutes
- A good candidate will  
- Know that Java can leak memory, and explain how inappropriately held references can cause it
- Can describe the symptoms of a memory leak, but may not know how to debug one
- Take no more than 5 minutes
- A bad candidate will  
- May know that Java can leak memory, but may not know how
- May not know how to recognize a memory leak in an application
- Take more 5 minutes to complete the question
- A terrible candidate will  
- Does not know that, or if, Java can leak memory
- Does not know how to recognize a memory leak in an application
.
Question Description: In Java, what does it mean for a class to be \'thread safe\'? What tools does Java provide to write thread-safe classes? If a class with no thread safety precautions is accessed by multiple threads, what kinds of errors might you see?
Scoring:
- A great candidate will  
- Be able to clearly explain that thread-safe classes guarantee consistency under multithreaded access
- List a substantial portion of the thread safety mechanisms that Java provides (synchronized, locks, volatile, immutability, anything in the util.concurrent package)
- Identify that the only error that you are likely to see is data corruption
- Take no more than 5 minutes
- A good candidate will  
- May have some difficulty explaining what a thread-safe class is, but at least mention that it won\'t suffer data issues when accessed by multiple threads
- List at least one thread safety mechanism in addition to the synchronized keyword
- May mention ConcurrentModificationException or deadlocks in addition to data corruption
- Take no more than 5 minutes
- A bad candidate will  
- Have difficulty explaining what a thread-safe class is beyond being safe to access with multiple threads
- Only know about the synchronized keyword as a thread safety mechanism
- Will not mention the possibility of data corrupti‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‌‍on
- Take more 5 minutes to complete the question
- A terrible candidate will  
- Be unable to describe what makes a class thread-safe. May assert that thread safety means \'all methods are synchronized\'
- May not know about the synchronized keyword
- Will be unsure of potential errors. May claim that ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown on any unsafe access in Java
- Take more than 10 minutes to finish the question

If a server is constantly crashing, what can you do?
server 什么意思？指的是不响应了，还是太慢，是service挂了还是node挂了？
You mentioned OOM…How to check if a process is killed by OOM?
dmesg 会有kernel得log， oom是一个exception了。
Solutions to prevent this from happening
如果需要大内存就加内存，如果是process不稳定而且只想把这一个process关起来可以用cgroup限制内存。
Can you explain what /procs folder is?
虚拟文档，在运行时才有得关于process得资讯，将process得状态以文件得形式表达出来，大部分得monitoring系统就是基于/proc里面得数据来做的。
Can you explain who updates this /procs?
kernel
If a CPU has a high load but low utilization, what can you do?
什么意思？值得是sys多过多?context switch 过多？还是interrupt过多？查看top/vmstat/htop拿到cpu得结果才知道
What about NFS?
远程文件系统，这个是io出问题了。
You talked  about tracerouter, can you explain how it works?
traceroute更改了 ttl用以获得响应时间

分享一下Meta VO，希望对大家有帮助，求米！第一轮, System Design:
跟我的background相关，设计一个embeded camera上传数据数据的系统，应该大多数人不会面到这题吧
第二轮：
两道算法题， 都是leetcode原题，但是我忘了。。。
第三轮：
考的system design，类似于设计一个Memcached，主要问题是问你要如何实现cache，用什么数据结构，如何实现get， set之类的function，一顿跟interviewer瞎聊
第四轮：
做了一道算法题，基础有点像力抠“散散灸”，
大概是给你一个JSON的数据结构，问你怎么serialize成一个string，比如“‍‌‌‍‍‌‌‍‌‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‌‍[12,3,5,[7,3,[2]],9,2]”,然后再deserialize回JSON，一个正向一个反向的倒腾
