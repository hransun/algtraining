/**
 * This solution uses dynamic programming to check if s3 is an interleaving of s1 and s2.
 * It uses a 2D boolean array dp with dimensions (m+1)x(n+1) where m is the length of s1
 * and n is the length of s2.
 * The boolean value dp[i][j] is true if s3[0...i+j-1] is an interleaving of s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-1].
 *
 * It first checks if the length of s1 + s2 is equal to the length of s3, if not return false.
 * Then it initializes all the base cases and fills the rest of the dp array
 * with the above mentioned logic and returns dp[m][n] which is the final result.
 *
 * It has a time complexity of O(mn) and space complexity of O(mn)

        This loop is initializing the first column of the 2D boolean array dp.

Here, i is the index for the string s1 and 0 is the index for the string s2. The loop starts from index 1 and goes till the end of the string s1.

The value of dp[i][0] is set to the value of dp[i-1][0] ANDed with the comparison of the character at the index i-1 of s1 and the character at the index i-1 of s3.

The dp[i-1][0] represents the substring of s1 and s3 until the i-1 index of s1 and s3. The comparison s1.charAt(i - 1) == s3.charAt(i - 1) checks if the current character of s1 and s3 are equal or not.

This loop is used to initialize the first column of dp array with the values that are true if the characters of s1 and s3 are equal at the same index.

So, this for loop helps in keeping track of the substring of s1 and s3 that are interleaved and updating the dp array accordingly.

 * Then it uses a queue to perform a topological sort on the graph,
